#Abyss Logs,,,,,,,
rat_abyss_log0,CUSTOM,Abyssal Matter,"There are lots of unique aspects about this environment, but one of the defining factors is the exotic matter that engulfs its entirety. Unlike the vacuum of space, moving through it causes constant drag on the hull's surface, and even though the forces at play are rather weak, the persistence of it drastically increases required maintenance.  

Not to mention that our sensory instruments are almost useless, as their signals decay after passing through even short distances of this stuff. We are essentially flying blindfolded.

I at least find the sound caused by the ship pushing against the abyssal matter to be rather calming, it is a nice change of pace compared to the dead silence of normal space.

Some crew reports hearing more than just those sounds, but I find it easy to blame that on the paranoia caused by our total isolation.
",,,,
rat_abyss_log1,CUSTOM,Mysterious Particles,"Within the abyssal matter, there are occasionally small clumps of especially charged mass. We aren't quite sure about the process that creates them, but they turn out to be quite useful for us. The sensors can distinguish them from the rest of the environment and track their paths. It helps us analyse the shifting flows and optimise our pathing for the least resistance.

There however appear to be certain zones that have an especially high concentration of those particles, and traversing them has caused at least a dozen electronic malfunctions for our fleet.

A few crew members seem to enjoy watching this anomaly through the fleet's instruments, it apparently reminds them of the weather of their homeworld.
",,,,
rat_abyss_log2,CUSTOM,Autonomous Operations,"Over time the expeditions in to the abyssal depths ramped up. As we discovered more use for the abyssal matter for new technologies, more parties started to show interest despite the danger. 

Due to this new found interest, the place has been flooded with autonomous droneships. Everyone is trying to either make the most of the financial gain connected to taking their own share, and such has been much easier when hulls don't have to be made to a human standard, or crew families compensated for accidental deaths.

Despite this, the AI cores prove rather unreliable at times. At times the droneships have been missing for days after their scheduled arrival date, and cores have been found to be rather unresponsive during their flights.

All this commotion even led to a new gate being constructed close to the surface of the abyss. There were concerns about how it would interact with the environment at first, but it appears to be working fine in the end. 
",,,,
rat_abyss_log3,CUSTOM,Vastness,"As we first discovered the abyssal depths, we were unable to make it through the terrain and had to wait for further supplies and improved hulls to arrive from beyond the gates. It would be suicide to attempt expeditions without that equipment.

We’ve been traversing it for months now, each time we surface back in to hyperspace and dive back in, we make some more progress in to its depths, but we haven't been able to discover anything new for a while now.

Despite that, there almost seems to be no end to this place. We still have so much to explain, and I'm sure we will find the answers somewhere deeper. 
",,,,
rat_abyss_log4,CUSTOM,Missed Schedule,"We’ve been reliant on the scheduled arrival of new supplies to keep this station running, but it has been days now and the fleets still haven't arrived. We have tried to contact nearby stations for help, but they can only offer the same complaint.

It seriously can’t be so hard to send new supplies through the gates, especially with so much capital at risk. How incompetent and irresponsible can they be up there? If this continues, we will have to abandon this station and make way for the upper levels. We have to hope that other stations on the way can spare us supplies for our journey back.
",,,,
rat_abyss_log5,CUSTOM,Breach,"On more than one occasion at this point, faults in the hull of some poor vessel caused some of the exotic matter to breach in to the ship. So far we have been lucky, and all breaches could be repaired before it turned in to the worst case scenario. 

However there was one incident that is stuck in my mind. On one such breach, a fellow crewman got exposed to the stuff with direct contact to his skin. Let's just say that it did not turn out well for him. He appeared fine at first, but just a few hours later he started screaming in agony. The medical team could find nothing wrong with his body, but he passed shortly after from the shock.

Whatever that shit is, I don't wanna be anywhere near it. And all of this was just from a brief contact with this fellow's skin. I wouldn't want to know how much worse longer exposure might be.
",,,,
rat_abyss_log6,CUSTOM,Pressure,"The deeper we descend, the denser the surrounding matter gets. We’ve tried to fly even further, but this density is proving to be too much of a logistical and navigational issue. Even with the recent increase in activity, no reasonable man is foolish enough to make their way through. Almost exclusively drones have been sent in to those environments, but proving our theory of the uninhabitability of those parts, only few make a return.

Of those that do, the cores seem weirdly…scarred. Not much in a physical way, but they have been behaving…oddly, to say the least. They have been inspected for damage, but nothing of significance has been found.

#Exo,,,,,,,
rat_exotech,FACTION,"A megacorporation once known as ""ExoTech Engineering"", a research and construction subsidiary of ""Altair Exotech"". Their primary purpose was on logistic efforts in the fringes of yet to be developed sectors. Being much more reliant on hyperspace technologies, much of their budget was invested into researching technologies for improved non-gate travel.

Eventually they’ve made the breakthrough they wanted, a stable fusion of a flux grid and phase-coil components, enabling the integration of hyper-dimensional aspects in a compactness barely ever seen before. With this technology they were able to construct their magnum opus, colossal stations capable of warping between systems at instantaneous speeds. Those quickly became known as “Exoships”. For a field-test, 5 of them were deployed within the Persean sector.

Now however, only one of them is known to remain. All others have been lost past the collapse, in wars the faction thought winnable due to their ability to move fast in a world send back to to a comparative stone age. But as major powers established, their aggressiveness backfired, and left barely any fragments of them left. 

But they haven't gone without spoils either, having hoarded and stolen numerous Domain-grade artifacts during the early collapse, and having developed many advanced systems for their own wars, some of their riches remain on their only Exoship. But as a small target with vast wealth, they became easy prey, and such now travel through the fringes of the sector, hoping to avoid any confrontation. Only few know of their actual location.

rat_exoship,CUSTOM,"A construct that stands at the center of all of Exotechs' life-support. Often referred to as ""exo-ship"", this gigantic station is capable of traversing towards other systems at a speed second only to gates.

rat_thestia,SHIP,"A rather compact carrier, designed to house only a single bay area. The deployed fighters are connected to an experimental device, based on effects first observed within the Arkas-class, creating what appears to be afterimages that can assist in combat. Not much is understood about the mechanics, and it is still unknown where those ""afterimages"" come from.

It is the first craft within the faction's line-up to integrate an experimental version of the Exoships' warp-drive into a small frame. While this integration has a massively decreased maximum range, it is enough to turn the tides of battle from carefully planned use of the ship.",,,,,
rat_tylos,SHIP,"As one of the latest design in the factions line-up, the Tylos-Class showcases all the extremes researched over dozens of cycles. The technology is used to force specific compartments into a state of constant superposition, enabling the instant replacement of everything within it at the press of a button. Due to the inherent danger stemming from this tech, the ship has quickly gained a reputation that strikes fear into any crew that gets assigned to it.",,,,,

rat_arkas,SHIP,"The defining Exo-Tech ship, being the first military iteration of the companies exo-grid technology, built from materials they hoarded in the early cycles after the collapse. The extended use of the exo-grid technology allowed them to create incredibly integrated phase-systems for a ship of its size, enabling a much more stable phasecloak. The flux-grid powered shipsystem manages to put a large amount of pressure on to its opponents at a moments notice.",,,,,
rat_leanira,SHIP,"The largest battlecarrier within the exo-tech doctrine. Its design was conceived to fill the weaknesses of the Arkas-class in real combat, providing support from both far and near distances when required. It is built with a large, hollow interior that is almost entirely dedicated to hosting its deployable ""apheidas"" platform. Due to the deployment systems limited range, it is known to fight in closer ranges than the average carrier, the same system however allows it to fully support itself within those close quarters.",,,,,
